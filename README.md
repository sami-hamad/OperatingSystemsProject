# OperatingSystemsProject
Operating Systems Course Project

- This is a project for Operating Systems Course at PSUT
- The .cpp file contains an implementation of Bankerâ€™s algorithm to avoid deadlocks, which might happen when using multiple instances of resources.
- The application have a user interface that asks the user to enter: number of processes, number of resources, number of instances of each resource, 
  currently allocated resources to a process, maximum number of resources for each process and number of available instances of each resource type.
- The application tells if the system is in a safe or in unsafe state and whether there is a deadlock or not.
- If there is a safe sequence, it will be displayed. If the system is in an unsafe state, the partial sequence will be displayed.
